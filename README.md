# ETSEMaps Graph Modification Project

This project, developed as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures course, focuses on modifying the graph ADT for the implementation of the ETSEMaps browser.

## Description

The goal of this project is to modify the graph ADT for the ETSEMaps browser implementation. The main requirements include making the graph weighted, changing the vertex type, adding functions for creating and deleting arcs, and implementing functions for calculating adjacency between nodes. Additionally, a function is required to initialize the graph with a given figure, and for version 2 of ETSEMaps, a program must be implemented to calculate optimal routes and minimum infrastructure of connections using the Floyd-Warshall and Prim's algorithms.

## Requirements

- Weighted graph implementation
- Change of vertex type from integer to character string
- Addition of functions for creating and deleting arcs
- Implementation of functions for calculating adjacency between nodes
- Initialization function for the graph
- Implementation of optimal route calculation and minimum infrastructure of connections using Floyd-Warshall and Prim's algorithms

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the project files.
